        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> The head element contains information about a webpage
            that is not visible in the browser, such as meta data
          </li>
          <Li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</Li>
          <li> Although commonly used interchangably, a tag only one part of an element,
            whereas an element is both the openening and closing statement
          </li>
          <li> HTML is the structural part of a website</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is used to provide style to a website</li>
          <li> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li> A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li> A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li> CSS rules can be assigned to individual elements of a website</li>
          <li> Alternatively a class attribute such as .card can be used a a selector to 
              assign CSS rules to multiple elements.
          </li>

      <h2>GIT</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li> git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Javascript allows a user to interact with a website
          such as filling in forms or using a search function
        </li>
        <li> A variable is a name container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
        <li> Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <li> An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
        <li> Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related</li>
        <li> An array can store different types of data within the same array</li>
        <li> The indexing of an array always starts with 0 and goes up incrementally 
          by one
        </li>
        <li> Different data types are declared in arrays in specific ways,
          strings are declared in quotation marks, numbers and boolean values are
          declared without any quotation marks
        </li>
        <h3>Conditional statements and Loops</h3>
        <li>Loops are a more efficient way of implementing repetitive code</li>
        <li> A for loop has three sections in its declaration
             First the starting point, then the number of iterations, followed
            by how the initial variable is to changed, usually incremented
          by 1 after each iteration </li>
          <li> Javascript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language
          </li>
          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <li> A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how
            to perform a certain task
          </li>
          <li> A function groups a set of instructions such that it can
            be called anytime you want a particular task to be performed
          </li>
          <li> To use functions, there are two steps, first the fuction needs to
            be defined and then it needs to be called.
          </li>
      <br>
      <li>Remember, it is always good practice to indent code that nests
        within arrays, loops or functions to give your work a good and
        appealing structure </ul>
